# Tamaguino
This is a fork of the Tamagotchi clone for Arduino. More information on the original creater can be found at:

I wanted to undertake this project for a number of reasons.
1) Exposure to using LiPo rechargable batteries. This was a great introduction to being able to start making my electronic projects more portable.
2) Exposure to using OLED display module (SSD1306). This is a great way to display real-time information from a microcontroller and being able to control this sort of hardware opens up a lot of future potental in projects I undertake.
3) Exposure to the Arduino pro mini and the use of an external UART (FTDI USB to TTL) to program the microcontroller. Using the pro mini will allow me to produce devices with a much smaller form factor in the future. 
4) My wife really wanted an Tamaguino pet!
